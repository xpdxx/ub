Working with Remotes

To be able to collaborate on any GIT project, you need to know
how to manage your remote repositories. Remote repositories are
versions of your project that are hosted on the internet or
network somewhere. You can have several of them, each of which
generally is either read-only or read/write for you.
Collaborating with others involves managing these remote 
repositories and pushing and pulling data to and from them when
you need to share work. Managing remote repositories includes
knowing how to add remote repositories, remove remotes that are
no longer valid, manage various remote branches and define them
as being tracked or not, and more. In thi section, we'll cover
some of these management skills.
